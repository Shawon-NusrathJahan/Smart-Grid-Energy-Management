# Smart-Grid-Energy-Management
A simple console-based group project showcasing algorithmic problem-solving using three core approaches: Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, and Greedy Algorithms. Developed as part of a course assignment to demonstrate understanding of these fundamental techniques. Future improvements may be added based on feedback or extended requirements.

---

This is a console-based C++ program developed as a course project to demonstrate the implementation of three fundamental algorithmic approaches:

- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**

Each method is represented by a classic algorithm and implemented in a way that showcases both logic and practical use. This project was built by a team of three members, with equal contribution and clearly defined responsibilities.


## Algorithms Implemented

| Method               | Algorithm Used              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Divide and Conquer   | _[Algorithm to be inserted]_ |
| Dynamic Programming  | 0/1 Knapsack Problem         |
| Greedy Algorithm     | Activity Selection Problem   |

## Technologies Used

- Language: **C++**
- Input Method: **File-based input**
- Console output with sample cases included

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Compile and run the file** (on Linux/macOS):

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o program
   ./program
   ```

   Or (on Windows):

   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o program.exe
   program.exe
   ```

> No additional input is required during execution. The program reads from predefined input files for demonstration purposes.

## Future Enhancements

* Implement additional algorithms for each strategy
* Introduce a **menu-driven system** for user interaction
* Allow **real-time input** via the console or config file
* Optional: Add a **GUI** (Graphical User Interface) for visualization

## File Structure

```bash
üìÅ Smart-Grid-Energy-Management/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp           # Single source file containing all algorithm implementations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ input/             # Folder containing input files for each algorithm
````

## Notes

* This project was developed as a group coursework assignment.
* It serves as a demonstration of understanding algorithmic problem-solving approaches.
