# Smart-Grid-Energy-Management
A simple console-based group project showcasing algorithmic problem-solving using three core approaches: Dynamic Programming, Divide and Conquer, and Greedy Algorithms. Developed as part of a course assignment to demonstrate understanding of these fundamental techniques. Future improvements may be added based on feedback or extended requirements.

---

This is a console-based C++ program developed as a course project to demonstrate the implementation of three fundamental algorithmic approaches:

- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy Algorithms**

Each method is represented by a classic algorithm and implemented in a way that showcases both logic and practical use. This project was built by a team of three members, with equal contribution and clearly defined responsibilities.


## Algorithms Implemented

| Method               | Algorithm Used              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Divide and Conquer   | [----]|
| Dynamic Programming  | [----]        |
| Greedy Algorithm     | [----]  |

## Technologies Used

- Language: **C++**
- Input Method: **File-based input**
- Console output with sample cases included

## Requirements to Run

- A C++ compiler supporting **C++17** standard or higher (e.g., GCC 7+, Clang 5+, MSVC 2017+)
- Any modern IDE or code editor such as **Code::Blocks**, **Visual Studio Code**, or **CLion**
- Command-line access to compile and run the program (optional but recommended)

> **Note:** No manual input is needed during execution. The program automatically reads from predefined input files included in the repository for demonstration purposes.
